# Tile Wanderer
Put this project onto github for the purposes of archiving old projects. Made in 2017.

Works on Windows, linux, and mac.

## Overview
My goal was to learn C++ by creating a simple game that ran through the console. I recreated the game twice to learn more in the [second version](https://github.com/EvanGyori/Tile-Wander-2).

Now, when I go back to look at the code of the project, it looks very goofy. Half of the comments explaining syntax were just wrong. However, I am glad I learned C++ as it is my favorite language now and most of my projects are in C++.

Procedurally generated console turn based game. Kill enemies to collect better weapons and loot.

## Usage
Create a build directory and run cmake from it
```
cmake <project-source-directory>
cmake --build .
```
Creates an executable called `TileWander`.
